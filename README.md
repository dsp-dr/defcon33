## Usage

This project is organized into specialized tracks that align with DEFCON's various villages and activities:

- **AI Village**: Research on AI/ML security, adversaport_number
- **Blue Team**: Defensive cybersecurity practices and incident response
- **Capture The Flag**: Competition challenges and educational puzzles
- **Red Team**: Ethical hacking and penetration testing methodologies
- **Tools**: Custom utilities and automation scripts
- **Workshops**: Hands-on learning materials

## Media Mirror

To create a local mirror of DEFCON 33 media content, you can use the provided Makefile target:

```bash
make mirror-media
```

This will create a git-ignored local copy of presentations, videos, and other media files from the official DEFCON 33 media server.
