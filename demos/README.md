## Safety Guidelines

- **EDUCATION ONLY**: All demos are for educational and defensive purposes
- **ISOLATED ENVIRONMENTS**: Run demonstrations only in controlled lab environments
- **NO UNAUTHORIZED TESTING**: Never test against systems you don't own
- **RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE**: Follow ethical disclosure practices for real vulnerabilities

## Setup Requirements

Many demos require isolated virtual environments or dedicated lab networks. Ensure proper isolation before running any demonstrations.
